                       <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                       <p align="justify">I'm Humaira Binta Awal, majoring in Physics from the University of Dhaka. Besides academic studies, I try to engage myself in developing my programming skills. I've completed different programming-based projects,  from web development to physics simulation or computational physics-based problem-solving. Before talking about HP's Physics Blog, I'd like to introduce you to HP! It's come from my self-keeping name, "Humu Pii"! In tech-world(irrespective of my programming website and project portfolios), my introduction starts with this name! So don't get confused! Now let's come to this physics self-learning notebook!</p>
                     <p align="justify">During the lockdown period, I have been indulging myself in programming stuff, i.e., it's projects or learning something new related to programming besides my academic physics learning. But as a Physics student, what first comes to my mind that how to connect my gradual self-learning programming skills with physics. As a part of wed-development, blog-making was my 1st concern. And on its branch project, I created this physics blog where I try to attach recent or interesting physics-related works by making my notes from either paper works or journal sites. Though its contents are not that adequate still, I like to learn physics at my own pace. But all the time, I couldn't update my academic pressure. Still, by visiting, you will know about my learning stuff along will get an easy understanding from my notes collected from different sources. This self-making physics notebook not only increases my interest in learning physics but also increases my ability to research correlated topics in more innovative ways!</p>
                       <p align="justify"> I hope that, in the future, I will leverage my learning and make different recent scientific contents that can amaze enthusiastic people like me. So take care and Sayonara! :D</p>
                       <p align="justify"> N.B.- Updated: Here, I've updated my website. I'm so happy about it. Through the help of phy.org and other sources, I've done it. Moreover, to build this static web blog site, I had to program all the backstage codings in HTML and CSS. The next idea is to solve different physics problems with programming and visualization. I Hope, I'll cope with it. Good luck. Allah Hafez!</p>
