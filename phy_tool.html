 <div><h1>Cubic Spline Interpolation</h1>
    <p align="justify">
        <b>Definition: </b>Cubic spline is a spline(a piecewise polynomial fuction that can have a locally very simple form,yet at the same time be globally flexible and smooth and useful for modeling arbitrary functions) constucted of piecewise 3rd order polynoials which pass through a set of control points. The 2nd derivative of each polynomial is commonly set to zero at the end points,since this provides a boundary condition that completes the system of equations.
<br>
        I know its very zigzag definition, so 1st let's make it simple... Like why we need it?
        <br>
        <b>Behind the scene: </b>
        Real world numerical data are difficult to analyze and fall them under a function and finding the function is not that simple. So Cubic spline method is developed where a series of unique cubic
        polynomials are fitted between each of the data points, with the stipulation(condition) that the curve
        obtained be continuous and appear smooth.
        <br>
        <b>Uses:</b>These cubic splines can then be used to determine rates of change and cumulative change over an interval. Splines interpolate equally spaced data points, although a more robust(strong) form could encompass(include)unequally spaced points.<br>
        <b>Funamental Idea: </b>Cubic spline interpolation is based on the engineer’s tool
        used <mark>to draw smooth curves through a number of points.</mark>
        <p align="justify">This spline consists of weights
            attached to a flat surface at the points to be connected. A flexible strip is then bent across
            each of these weights, resulting in a pleasingly smooth curve.
            The mathematical spline is similar in principle. The points, in this case, are numerical
            data. The weights are the coefficients on the cubic polynomials used to interpolate the data.
            These coefficients ’bend’ the line so that it passes through each of the data points without
            any erratic behavior or breaks in continuity.
            </p>

    </div><p align="justify"><b>Advantage: </b>Cubic spline is used as the method of interpolation because of the advantages it provides in terms of simplicity of calculation, numerical stability and smoothness of the interpolated curve.<br>
    <b>Usage: </b>Cubic spline interpolation is a special case for Spline interpolation that is used very often to avoid the problem of Runge's phenomenon. This method gives an interpolating polynomial that is smoother and has smaller error than some other interpolating polynomials such as Lagrange polynomial and Newton polynomial.<br><br>
<b>Why is a 3 degree polynomial used in a cubic spline? : </b>A cubic polynomial y=ax3+bx2+cx+d has four degrees of freedom, thus allowing to prescribe a total of four conditions, such as passing through two points and having specific slopes at two points.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/f4iNbNRKZKU">Cubic Spline</a></p>

<h1>What causes lightning and thunder?</h1>
<h3><span><font size="+7">L</font>ightning!</span></h3>
<h4>What causes lightning?</h4>
<p align="justify">Lightning begins as static charges in a rain cloud. Winds inside the cloud are very turbulent. Water droplets in the bottom part of the cloud are caught in the updrafts and lifted to great heights where the much colder atmosphere freezes them. Meanwhile, downdrafts in the cloud push ice and hail down from the top of the cloud. Where the ice going down meets the water coming up, electrons are stripped off.</p>
<p align="justify">It's a little more complicated than that, but what results is a cloud with a negatively charged bottom and a positively charged top. These electrical fields become incredibly strong, with the atmosphere acting as an insulator between them in the cloud.</p>
<p>When the strength of the charge overpowers the insulating properties of the atmosphere, Z-Z-Z-ZAP! Lightning happens.</p><img src="images/phy_images/acquiring-charge.gif">
<h2>How does the lightning "know" where to discharge—or strike?</h2>
<p align="justify">The electric field "looks" for a doorknob. Sort of. It looks for the closest and easiest path to release its charge. Often lightning occurs between clouds or inside a cloud.</p>
<p>But the lightning we usually care about most is the lightning that goes from clouds to ground—because that's us!</p>
<p align="justify">As the storm moves over the ground, the strong negative charge in the cloud attracts positive charges in the ground. These positive charges move up into the tallest objects like trees, telephone poles, and houses. A "stepped leader" of negative charge descends from the cloud seeking out a path toward the ground. Although this phase of a lightning strike is too rapid for human eyes, this slow-motion video shows it happening.</p>

<p align="justify">As the negative charge gets close to the ground, a positive charge, called a streamer, reaches up to meet the negative charge. The channels connect and we see the lightning stroke. We may see several strokes using the same path, giving the lightning bolt a flickering appearance, before the electrical discharge is complete.</p>

<h1>What causes thunder?</h1>
<p align="justify">In a fraction of a second, lightning heats the air around it to incredible temperatures—as hot as 54,000 °F (30,000 °C). That's five times hotter than the surface of the Sun!</p>
<p>The heated air expands explosively, creating a shockwave as the surrounding air is rapidly compressed. The air then contracts rapidly as it cools. This creates an initial CRACK sound, followed by rumbles as the column of air continues to vibrate.

<p align="justify">If we are watching the sky, we see the lightning before we hear the thunder. That is because light travels much faster than sound waves. We can estimate the distance of the lightning by counting how many seconds it takes until we hear the thunder. It takes approximately 5 seconds for the sound to travel 1 mile. If the thunder follows the lightning almost instantly, you know the lightning is too close for comfort!</p>
<h2>What does lightning look like from space?</h2>
<p align="justify">Lightning is an important part of weather forecasting. The Geostationary Lightning Mapper instrument on the GOES-R series satellites can detect lightning activity over nearly the whole Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p align="justify"> Scientists use data from GOES-R series satellites, along with data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor on NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, to study lightning. This complete picture of lightning at any given time will improve "now-casting" of dangerous thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, and flash floods.</p>
