                       <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                       <p align="justify">I'm Humaira Binta Awal, currently majoring in Physics from the University of Dhaka. Beside academic studies I try to engage myself into developing my programming skils. I've completed different programming based projects starting from web-development to physics simulaton or computational physics based problem solving. Before talking about my this HP's Physics Blog, I'd like to introduce you about HP! It's come from my self-keeping name "Humu Pii"! In tech-world(irrespective to my programming website and project-portfolios)my intro starts with this name! So don't get confused! Now comes about my this physics self-learning notebook!</p>
                     <p align="justify">From the lock-down period, I have been indulging myself into programming stuffs whether it's project or learning something new related to programming. But as a Physics student what comes to me that how to connect my gradual self-learning programming skills with physics. As a part of wed-development, blog making was my 1st concern. And on its branch project I created this physics blog where I try to attach recent or interesting physics related works by making my own notes from either paper works or journal sites. Though it's contents are not quite adequite still I like to learn physics in my own pase. And all the time I couldn't update for my academic pressure. Still by vising you will get an easy understanding from my notes collecting from different sources. This increases my interest in learning physics with more innovative ways!</p>
                       <p align="justify"> Hope in the future, I will leverage my learning and make different recent scientific contents that can amaze enthusiastic people like me. So take care and Sayonara! :D</p>
                       <p align="justify"> N.B. Updated: Here I've updated my website. I'm so happy about it. Through the help of phy.org and other sources, I've done it. To do so, I also had to innovate some coding in CSS along with HTML. The next idea is for --. Hope that I'll cope up with it. Good luck. Allah Hafez!</p>
